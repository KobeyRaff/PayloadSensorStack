Code implementation:
SD Card over SPI
    SD MOSI: 37
    SD MISO: 31
    SD CLK: 30
    SD CS: 29

LSM6DSOTR over SPI
    LSM6DSOTR MOSI: 16
    LSM6DSOTR MISO: 14
    LSM6DSOTR CLK: 13
    LSM6DSOTR CS: 23

MPU6050 over I2C
    MPU6050 SDA: 33
    MPU6050 SCL: 36

BME280 over I2C
    BME280 SDA: 33
    BME280 SCL: 36

Stat LED 1-3
    Stat LED 1: 8
    Stat LED 2: 9
    Stat LED 3: 10

Buzzer
    Buzzer: 26 (GPIO 4)
    Buzzer indicator noises on startup, experiment start, 
    experiment stop and landing



Camera control
    Camera control: 24 (GPIO 2)
    This should be able to control both cameras through one pin
    Otherwise we could do a UART or I2C control

Motor Driver control
    Should be able to control both motors with 1 pin

    If we use this, just need a PWM output

Currently has no GPS or magnetometer, but these can be added if needed.
